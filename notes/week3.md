# Week 3
## Pumping Lemma
 * Used to show some language is not regular "not an automana"
 * If it is an infinite language there must be a loop in the state machine to be regular
 * Must show that there is no loop to show not regular
 * A language is regular if there exists a regular expression that defines it
## Automatic Generation
 * RE->NFA
 * NFA->DFA
 * DFA->MFA
 * MFA->LA
## Thompson's Construction
 * RE to NFA
  * Base Case
  * Alternation
  * Concactenation
  * Closure
## Evaluation TC
 * Simple Transformations for each operator
    * Preserved Properties
    * One start state
    * one end state
    * No transitions from end state
## Subset Construction
 * NFA to DFA
## Hopcroft's Algorithm
 * DFA to Minimal DFA
