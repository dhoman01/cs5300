## Instructions for Assignment 1
1. $> cd ../
2. $> mkdir build && cd build
3. $> cmake /path/to/my/project && make
4. $> ./cpslcc /path/to/lexical_test.cpsl

*Note: I tested with the lexical_text.cpsl file found in Dr. Sundberg's GitHub [repo](https://github.com/ksundberg/CS5300/blob/master/TestFiles/lexical_test.cpsl)*

*Note: The lexical_test.cpsl included has been modified to test for the following cases: incorrect identifiers, empty character constants, and non-terminating character constants*
