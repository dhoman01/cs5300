Assignment:
----------------------------
i=1
j=2
k=3
a=1
b=0
c=c
s=Dave

Arithmetic Expressions:
----------------------------
1 + 1 = 2
i + j = 3
2 * 2 = 4
i * j = 2
4 / 2 = 2
j / i = 2
4 % 2 = 0
k % j = 1

Boolean Experssions:
----------------------------
true & false is 0
a & b is 0
true | false is 1
a | b is 1
2 <> 2 is 0
b <> a is 1
i <> j is 1
s <> "Scott" is 1
1 = 2 is 0
a = true is 1
i = j is 0
s = "Dave" is 1
1 < 2 is 1
i < j is 1
1 > 2 is 0
i > j is 0
2 <= 3 is 1
j <= j is 1
2 >= 3 is 0
j >= j is 1

Unary Expressions:
----------------------------
~true is 0
~a is 0
~(i = j) is 1
-k is 2
chr(65) is A
chr(k) is 
ord('A') is 65
